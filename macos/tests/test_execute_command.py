"""Regression tests for ax.core.ExecuteCommand process handling.

These cover the three ways the old subprocess.run(capture_output=True)
implementation misbehaved under the stdio transport:

1. The child inherited fd 0 -- the JSON-RPC request stream -- so any command
   that reads stdin swallowed the client's protocol messages.
2. A backgrounded grandchild inherited the stdout *pipe* and held it open
   after the direct child exited, so a command that finished instantly was
   reported as having timed out.
3. On a real timeout only /bin/bash was killed, leaving its descendants alive.
